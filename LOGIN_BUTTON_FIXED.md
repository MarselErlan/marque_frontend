# ✅ Login Button Fixed - Now Opens Phone Modal

## 🐛 Issue Found

When clicking the "Войти" (Login) button in the header for the first time, the phone verification modal was not appearing.

---

## 🔍 Root Causes

### 1. Missing AuthModals Component

**Problem:** The `AuthModals` component was not imported or rendered in the Header.

**Impact:** Even though `auth.requireAuth()` was setting `isPhoneModalOpen = true`, there was no modal component to display it.

### 2. Callback Function Bug

**Problem:** In `hooks/useAuth.ts`, line 206 had incorrect callback storage:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This immediately calls onSuccess()
setOnLoginSuccess(() => onSuccess());

// ✅ CORRECT - Store the function to call later
setOnLoginSuccess(() => onSuccess);
```

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Import AuthModals Component

**File:** `components/Header.tsx`

**Added import:**

```typescript
import { AuthModals } from "@/components/AuthModals";
```

### Fix 2: Render AuthModals Component

**File:** `components/Header.tsx` (Lines 232-248)

**Added at the end of the component:**

```typescript
{
  /* Authentication Modals */
}
<AuthModals
  isPhoneModalOpen={auth.isPhoneModalOpen}
  setIsPhoneModalOpen={auth.setIsPhoneModalOpen}
  isSmsModalOpen={auth.isSmsModalOpen}
  setIsSmsModalOpen={auth.setIsSmsModalOpen}
  phoneNumber={auth.phoneNumber}
  setPhoneNumber={auth.setPhoneNumber}
  countryCode={auth.countryCode}
  setCountryCode={auth.setCountryCode}
  smsCode={auth.smsCode}
  setSmsCode={auth.setSmsCode}
  handlePhoneSubmit={auth.handlePhoneSubmit}
  handleSmsVerification={auth.handleSmsVerification}
  isSendingSms={auth.isSendingSms}
  isVerifyingCode={auth.isVerifyingCode}
/>;
```

### Fix 3: Correct Callback Storage

**File:** `hooks/useAuth.ts` (Line 207)

**Before:**

```typescript
setOnLoginSuccess(() => onSuccess());
```

**After:**

```typescript
setOnLoginSuccess(() => onSuccess);
```
