# 🔧 Webpack Module Loading Error - FIXED

## ❌ **Critical Error**

```
Uncaught TypeError: can't access property "call", originalFactory is undefined
```

**Symptoms:**

- App completely crashes on load
- Hydration errors
- "can't access property 'call', originalFactory is undefined" in console
- Page doesn't render at all

---

## 🐛 **Root Cause**

This is a **webpack module loading error** caused by:

1. **Corrupted webpack cache** after code changes
2. **Hot Module Replacement (HMR) cache conflict**
3. **Stale .next build directory**

This commonly happens after:

- Making multiple file changes
- Updating import statements
- Modifying TypeScript types
- Changing module exports

---

## ✅ **Solution**

### Quick Fix (30 seconds)

```bash
# 1. Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# 2. Clear webpack cache
rm -rf node_modules/.cache

# 3. Restart dev server
pnpm dev
```

### If Problem Persists

```bash
# Full clean rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

---

## 📊 **What Was Done**

1. ✅ Cleared `.next` directory (Next.js build cache)
2. ✅ Cleared `node_modules/.cache` (webpack cache)
3. ✅ Restarted dev server with clean build

---

## 🔍 **Why This Happens**

### Webpack Module System

When you make changes to:

- Import statements
- TypeScript types
- Component exports

Webpack's Hot Module Replacement can sometimes get confused and cache outdated module references. This causes the "originalFactory is undefined" error because webpack is trying to call a function that no longer exists or was never properly registered.

### The Fix

Clearing the cache forces webpack to:

1. Re-analyze all modules
2. Rebuild the dependency graph
3. Create fresh module factories
4. Properly register all exports

---

## 🎯 **Prevention**

### When to Clear Cache

Clear `.next` and `node_modules/.cache` when you experience:

- Webpack module errors
- Hydration errors after code changes
- Components not updating
- Import errors that don't make sense
- "Module not found" for files that exist

### Quick Command

Add this to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "clean": "rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache",
    "dev:clean": "rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache && pnpm dev"
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm run dev:clean
```

---

## ✅ **Verification**

After clearing cache and restarting:

1. ✅ **No webpack errors** in console
2. ✅ **Page loads successfully**
3. ✅ **No hydration warnings**
4. ✅ **All components render**

---

## 📝 **Related Issues**

This fix also resolves:

- "Module not found" errors (when file exists)
- Hydration mismatches after code changes
- Components showing old code
- TypeScript types not updating
- Hot reload not working

## 🚀 **Status**

| Item                    | Status          |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| Webpack cache cleared   | ✅ Complete     |
| .next directory cleared | ✅ Complete     |
| Dev server restarted    | ✅ Running      |
| App loading             | ✅ **Working!** |

---

## 💡 **Pro Tip**

**Always try clearing the cache first** when you get weird webpack/module errors after making code changes. It's the fastest fix for 90% of Next.js build issues!
